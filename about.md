# About

## The Vision

The vision is to provide a better way of programming Lisp in CAD with immediate benefits to the coder, the user and the community.  
By combining the functionality that **SOZ** provides, with the visual experience of **LIVE**, the project creates a niche product not seen before.  
All written in the one language, Lisp.  

## Timeline

### Past (2013 - 2024)

The SOZ-LIVE project has been developed for the last 10 years with a team of one and as a closed source project.  
Initially developed to draw entities in CAD that were unavailable or took a long time to draw, it has grown to take a more all encompassing approach.  
The addition of the LIVE User Interface and a dynamic DCL based GUI has increased the functionality of the project.  

### Present

The project is currently closed source and in Private Beta stage, with work required to reach a mature and stable product.  
The current aim is to develop a community of developers and testers to progress the project to release stage.  

### Future (2025 - ?)

The aim is to move to Open Source when a mature v2.0 product is released.<br>
This is expected to be in 2025.  
The future includes a long list of potential areas, features and functionality on the Roadmap for further development.  
The expansion of the community will also enable further growth and development of the project.


## The Team

### Tim Marchbank - Project Lead

Developed an interest in programming Lisp and CAD customisation during university 30 years ago.  
This interest was developed further during his career and led to previous iterations of what would become SOZ-LIVE.  
He has been developing the project since 2013 after wanting entities in CAD that weren't available in base products.  
It was soon after that he realised the potential depth and breadth of the project for the wider community.  
The desire to see others benefit from the project provides the drive to continue to develop the project.
