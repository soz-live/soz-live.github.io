# About


## Introduction

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2600 Lisp routines, that enables the creation of complex CAD entities, from a series of inputs of simpler objects. It builds upon basic types such numbers and vectors to entities such as Lines and Planes to enable the modelling of complex Parts made of Features.


## SOZ

### The What of SOZ

**SOZ** is a means of combining:

- Functional Programming (FP)
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
- Scripting

All programmed in Lisp.
 

### The Why of SOZ

**SOZ** was created to enable:

- powerful but simple access to CAD objects through Lisp.
- parametric modelling of complex 3D Solid entities.

Along the way, benefits of using the **SOZ** approach became apparent, including:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes.
- Adding to the functionality of CAD.  

## LIVE 

### The What of LIVE

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design.

### The How of LIVE

The routines are built into the Core of **SOZ**, and consist of around 1000 lines of code.

**LIVE** objects, such as Nodes and Links, are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.  This enables complex models and arrangements to be created, enabling iterative design of the models.


## The Vision

The vision is to provide a better way of programming Lisp in CAD with immediate benefits to the coder, the user and the community.  
By combining the functionality that **SOZ** provides, with the visual experience of **LIVE**, the project aims to create a niche product not seen before.  


## Timeline

### Past (2013 - 2024)

The SOZ-LIVE project has been developed for the last 10 years with a team of one and as a closed source project. Initially developed to draw entities in CAD that were unavailable or took a long time to draw, it has grown to take a more all encompassing approach. The addition of the LIVE User Interface and a dynamic DCL based GUI has increased the functionality of the project.  

### Present

The project is currently closed source and in **Private Beta**, with work still required to reach a mature and stable product. The current aim is to develop a community of developers and testers to progress the project to release stage.  

### Future (2025 - ?)

The aim is to move to Open Source when a mature v2.0 product is released, expected to be in 2025.  
The future includes a list of potential areas, features and functionality for further development.  
The expansion of the community will also enable further growth and development of the project.  


## The Team

### Tim Marchbank - Project Lead

Tim developed an interest in programming Lisp and CAD customisation during university days.  
This interest was developed further during his career and led to previous iterations of what would become SOZ-LIVE.  
He has been developing the project since 2013 after wanting entities in CAD that weren't available in base products, and soon after realised the potential depth and breadth of the project for the wider community. The desire to see others benefit from the project provides the drive to continue to develop the project.
