# About

## SOZ

### The What of SOZ

For Users, **SOZ** provides a consistent environment to develop complex CAD models, from a series of inputs of simpler objects using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It builds upon basic types such numbers and strings, all the way to the modelling of complex 3D Parts made of Features.

For Coders, **SOZ** is a means of combining Functional Programming (FP), Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Scripting, all programmed in Lisp.

 
### The Why of SOZ

**SOZ** was created to enable:

- powerful but simple access to CAD objects through Lisp.
- parametric modelling of complex 3D Solid entities.

Along the way, benefits of using the **SOZ** approach became apparent, including:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes.
- Adding to functionality.  
- Automated documentation of code.

## LIVE 

### The What of LIVE

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design.  
The routines are built into the core of **SOZ**, and consist of around 1000 lines of code.

### The How of LIVE

**LIVE** objects, such as Nodes and Links, are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.  This enables complex models and arrangements to be created, enabling iterative design of the models.


## The Vision

The vision is to provide a better way of programming Lisp inside of CAD with immediate benefits to coders, users and the community. 
By combining the functionality that **SOZ** provides, with the visual experience of **LIVE**, the project aims to create a niche product capable of providing the user with a means of generating itarative models and the coder with a basis to develop the project's code-base in new directions.  


## Timeline

### Past (2013 - 2025)

The SOZ-LIVE project has been developed for the last 12 years with a team of one and as a closed source project.  
Initially developed to draw entities in CAD that were unavailable or took a long time to draw, it has grown to take a more all encompassing approach.  
The recent additions of the LIVE User Interface and a dynamic DCL based GUI has increased the functionality and useability of the project.  

### Present

The project is currently closed source and in **Private Beta**, with work still required to reach a mature and stable product. The current aim is to develop a community of developers and testers to progress the project to release stage.  

### Future (2025 - ?)

The aim is to move to Open Source when a mature v2.0 product is released, expected to be in 2025.  
The future includes a list of potential areas, features and functionality for further development.  
The expansion of the community will also enable further growth and development of the project.  


## The Team

### Tim Marchbank - Project Lead

Tim developed an interest in programming Lisp and CAD customisation during university days.  
This interest was developed further during his career and led to previous iterations of what would become **SOZ-LIVE**.  
He has been developing the project since 2013 after wanting entities in CAD that weren't available in base products, and soon after realised the potential depth and breadth of the project for the wider community. The desire to see others benefit from the work provides the drive to continue to develop the project.
