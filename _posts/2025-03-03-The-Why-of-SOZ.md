Recently I was questioning why I continue to use and code using **SOZ-LIVE**. The answer that came to me was two-fold:

- For Users
- For Coders

## For Users

**SOZ-LIVE** provides users with additional functionality over Standard CAD functions / routines in the areas of 3D modelling and drafting of complex shapes and curves. All this is achieved with the added benefit of being able to edit and update functionality.<br>
It offers the user a variety user interfaces (UIs) including graphical (GUI) and a Node UI (LIVE) to visualise and work with the objects and entities created. <br>
Already it has been extended into the areas of Architectural Engineering & Construction (AEC), Rigging design and 3D Modelling.

## For Coders

**SOZ-LIVE** provides coders with a platform / framework / naming standard to follow that enables certain benefits over an ad-hoc approach. <br>
As well as enabling Object Oriented Programming (OOP) from a Functional or Scripting language, it's structured but simple means of achieving these goals makes it easy to develop extensions in the form of derived classes and scripts that enable the user to achieve more, faster.<br>
By applying the **SOZ-LIVE** system all the UIs (GUI and LIVE) for the users, and documentation for the help system are created automatically.

## Conclusion

And it is for those reasons that I continue to develop, code and use **SOZ-LIVE**.<br>
For me it is just the best way to code and to use CAD.<br>
And all using my favourite programming language, Lisp.
