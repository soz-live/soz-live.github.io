# SOZ-LIVE

## Introduction

**SOZ-LIVE** combines a modeller for complex Entities including Parts and Assemblies with a Node-based user interface (UI) - **LIVE** to enable iterative modelling.  Written in a Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) format within a Functional Programming (FP) language, Lisp, **SOZ-LIVE** provides the best of both worlds and gives creative power to both Users and Coders.


## Platforms

**SOZ-LIVE** can be run from within both BricsCAD and AutoCAD.

> **Notes**
> - 3D Modelling functionality requires BricsCAD Pro or above, or full AutoCAD.
> - Some Civil functionality is limited to BricsCAD Pro or above only.
