# SOZ-LIVE

**SOZ** = Scripted ObjectZ  
**LIVE** = Lisp Interactive Visual Environment  

**SOZ-LIVE** combines a modeller capable of creating complex Entities, including Parts and Assemblies, with a Node-based user interface (UI), **LIVE** to enable iterative modelling for Users.  
While being entirely written in Lisp, **SOZ-LIVE** combines the best of Functional, Object-Oriented & Scripting languages, giving creative power to Coders to extend and develop code using the project.

> **Notes**
> - 3D Modelling functionality requires BricsCAD Pro or above, or full AutoCAD.
> - Some Civil functionality is limited to BricsCAD Pro or above only.


## Status
