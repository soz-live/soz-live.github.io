## Status:

The current status of the project is **Private Beta**.

## Introduction

A CAD extension, written in LISP.<br>
**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2500 Lisp routines, that enables the creation of complex CAD entities, from a series of inputs of simpler objects.

## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ:

<details>

<summary>SOZ is a means to combine Functional Programming (FP), Object Oriented (OO) Programming and Scripting, using Lisp.</summary>

**SOZ** was created to enable:

- powerful but simple access to CAD objects through Lisp.
- modelling of complex 3D Solid entities.

Along the way, benefits of using the **SOZ** approach became apparent, including:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes
- adding to the functionality of CAD.

## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment:

<details>

<summary>LIVE is a Node-based visual User Interface (UI) written in SOZ that enables the user to create visual scripts for iterative design.</summary>

The routines are built into the Core of **SOZ**, and consist of under 1000 lines of code.

**LIVE** objects are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.
