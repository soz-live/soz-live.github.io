# SOZ-LIVE

A CAD extension, written in Lisp.  

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2500 Lisp routines, that enables the creation of complex CAD entities, from a series of inputs of simpler objects.

## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ:

**SOZ** is a means to combine Functional Programming (FP), Object Oriented (OO) Programming and Scripting, using Lisp.

**SOZ** was created to enable:

- powerful but simple access to CAD objects through Lisp.
- modelling of complex 3D Solid entities.

Along the way, benefits of using the **SOZ** approach became apparent, including:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes
- adding to the functionality of CAD.  


## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment:

**LIVE** is a Node-based visual User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual scripts for iterative design.

The routines are built into the Core of **SOZ**, and consist of under 1000 lines of code.

**LIVE** objects are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.

## As a CAD Extension:

**SOZ-LIVE** is being used to extend CAD functionality in the areas of:

- Drafting 
- 3D Modelling
  - Parts
  - Assemblies
- Architecture
- Engineering
  - Mechanical
  - Structural
  - Civil
- Construction
  - Rigging
  
## As a Lisp Extension:

**SOZ-LIVE** is a platform for developing additional Lisp functionality for CAD including:

- Structured
- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Extensible
- Readability
- Documentation


## Users:

Any users of BricsCAD or AutoCAD as code can be run on both platforms.<br>
Potential users include:

- Business
	- Designers
		- Engineers
		- Architects
		- Drafters
- Education
	- School
		- STEM Programs
	- University
- Artists
- Programmers

> **Notes:**<br>
> - 3D Modelling functionality requires BricsCAD Pro or above, or full AutoCAD.<br>
> - Some Civil functionality is limited to BricsCAD only.
