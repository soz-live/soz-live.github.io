# SOZ-LIVE

A CAD extension, written in Lisp.  

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 3400 Lisp routines, and around 30,000 lines of code, that combine to create a unform approach to using and coding within CAD packages such as BricsCAD and AutoCAD.

## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ


### For Users

**SOZ-LIVE** combines parametric creation and editing of drafting entities, a parametric 3D Solid modeller, a Node-based user interface (UI), **LIVE**, for iterative modelling, using a consistent Graphical User Interface (GUI).  

Refer to the [Users Introduction](/users/intro.html) for details.


### For Coders

**SOZ** is Lisp programming with a twist, and a means to combine:

- Functional Programming 
- Object Oriented Programming
- and a Scripting Language

Benefits of coding using the **SOZ** approach in programming include:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes.
- Adding to the functionality. 
- Automated documentation of code.

Refer to the [Coders Introduction](/coders/intro.html) for details.


## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design, with the routines built into the core of **SOZ**.

**LIVE** objects, such as Nodes and Links, are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace. This enables complex models and arrangements to be created, enabling iterative design of the models.


## Community

**SOZ-LIVE** aims to be a community for Users and Coders interested in developing the project to meet their needs and those of other uses of CAD who can benefit from the power and functionality provided. 

Refer to the [Community](/community.html) page for details.


## Security

**SOZ-LIVE** aims to be a trusted and secure project for Users and Coders alike. 

Refer to the [Security](/security.html) page for details.

## Status

The current status of the project is **Private Beta**.  

## AI

No AI has been used to generate code for this project - Lets keep it that way.  


## Platforms

**SOZ-LIVE** is written to be run from within both BricsCAD and AutoCAD.


{% include note-icon.html %}  
> 3D Modelling functionality requires BricsCAD Pro or above, or full AutoCAD.   
> TIN Surfaces and Civil functionality require BricsCAD Pro or above.  
> SOZ-LIVE is not affiliated with BricsCAD or AutoCAD.
