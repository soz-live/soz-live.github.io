# SOZ-LIVE

A CAD extension, written in Lisp.  

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2600 Lisp routines, and around 30,000 lines of code, that combine to create a unform approach to using and coding within CAD packages such as BricsCAD and AutoCAD.


## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ


### For Users

**SOZ-LIVE** combines parametric creation and editing of drafting entities, a parametric 3D Solid modeller, a Node-based user interface (UI), **LIVE**, for iterative modelling, using a consistent Graphical User Interface (GUI).  

Refer to the [Users Introduction](/users/intro.html) for details.


### For Coders

Written entirely in Lisp, **SOZ** combines the best of Functional, Object-Oriented & Scripting languages.  
With a structured and expressive approach to programming in CAD, **SOZ** gives creative power to Coders to extend and develop the project in the direction required.  

Refer to the [Coders Introduction](/coders/intro.html) for details.


## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design, with the routines built into the core of **SOZ**.


## Community

**SOZ-LIVE** aims to be a community for Users and Coders interested in developing the project to meet their needs and those of other uses of CAD who can benefit from the power and functionality provided. 

Refer to the [Community](/community.html) page for details.

## Status

The current status of the project is **Private Beta**.  


## Platforms

**SOZ-LIVE** is written to be run from within both BricsCAD and AutoCAD.
