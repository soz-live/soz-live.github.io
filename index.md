## Status

The current status of the project is **Private Beta**.

## Introduction

**SOZ-LIVE** is a CAD extension, written in LISP.<br>
**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2600 Lisp routines, that enables the creation of complex CAD entities, from a series of inputs of simpler objects.

## SOZ

### The What of SOZ

**SOZ** = Scripted ObjectZ  

**SOZ** is a means to combine Functional Programming (FP), Object Oriented (OO) Programming and Scripting, using Lisp.

### The Why of SOZ

**SOZ** was created to enable:

- powerful but simple access to CAD objects through Lisp.
- parametric modelling of complex 3D Solid entities.

Along the way, benefits of using the **SOZ** approach became apparent, including:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes
- adding to the functionality of CAD.  

## LIVE 

### The What of LIVE

**LIVE** = Lisp Interactive Visual Environment

**LIVE** is a Node-based visual User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual scripts for iterative design.

### The How of LIVE

The routines are built into the Core of **SOZ**, and consist of under 1000 lines of code.

**LIVE** objects, such as Nodes and Links, are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.

## For Users

**SOZ-LIVE** is being used to extend CAD functionality in the areas of:

- Drafting of
  - Points
  - Planes
  - Curves
  - Grids
  - Levels
- 3D Modelling of
  - Parts &
  - Assemblies
  
As well as for the following disciplines:
  
- Architecture
- Engineering
  - Mechanical
  - Structural
  - Civil
- Construction
  - Rigging
  
## For Coders

**SOZ-LIVE** is a platform for developing additional Lisp functionality for CAD, focussing on:

- Structure
- Consistency
- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Extensibility
- Readability
- Documentation

## Potential Users

**SOZ-LIVE** can be run on both BricsCAD and AutoCAD, for:

- Business
	- Designers
		- Engineers
		- Architects
		- Drafters
- Education
	- School
		- STEM Programs
	- University
- Artists
- Programmers

> **Notes:**<br>
> - 3D Modelling functionality requires BricsCAD Pro or above, or full AutoCAD.<br>
> - Some Civil functionality is limited to BricsCAD only.
