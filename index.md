**SOZ-LIVE** is a CAD Extension, written in Lisp.

**SOZ** = Scripted ObjectZ  
**LIVE** = Lisp Interactive Visual Environment  


## Status

The current status of the project is **Private Beta**.  


## For Users

**SOZ-LIVE** combines:

- parametric creation and editing of drafting entities such as:
  - Points
  - Lines
  - Arcs
  - Circles
  - Polylines 
- a 3D Solid modeller for:
  - Parts
  - Features
  - Assemblies
- a Node-based user interface (UI), **LIVE**, for iterative modelling.
- and a consistent Graphical User Interface (GUI).  

Refer to the [Users Introduction](/users/intro.html) for details.


## For Coders

Written entirely in Lisp, **SOZ** combines the best of:

- Functional, 
- Object-Oriented & 
- Scripting languages, 

With a structured and expressive approach to programming in CAD, **SOZ** gives creative power to Coders to extend and develop the project in the direction required.  

Refer to the [Coders Introduction](/coders/intro.html) for details.


## Platforms

**SOZ-LIVE** is written to be run from within both BricsCAD and AutoCAD.
